I've also attached 2 new homepage banners with the new copy and Mariners logo next to it and larger contact button. (or the entire top banner could be a clickable link that takes you through to the contact page)

The area at the bottom is now back with the photo of the site - its probably a good idea to have a link next to this saying "find out more" or similar that takes you through to the facilities page which has an even larger picture of the site (see attached mockup site.jpg)

Think this makes the homepage look a lot more interesting rather than trying to get everything squeezed into the same bit at the top. Obviously a new bit of homepage copy will be needed, a few sentences perhaps with further details on the opening and instructions on how to register you interest?

Rotating banner is working well, just need some real pics in there for the facilities etc!

Cheers

========================================================================

Prefer the top one for the opening page. Have to take the telephone number out as I do not yet have this, for now contact through the website and registering interest should be sufficient, although you could just put info@soccer5s.com on the space where the number is and maybe advanced bookings coming soon? What do you think?

Good idea with the facilities page
Brad is this good for you?

========================================================================

Let's just keep the links then. 

I'll give u them in 10mins.

Can u also change the number to

 02 9489 4450

Can u take the number away from front page. Only list it in our contact details please?

Can you replace the front page with info@soccer5s.com please?

I'll have a wee look and see if I can spot anything else. So we can be up and running asap.

Cheers bro
