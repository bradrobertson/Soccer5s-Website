    <h2>Soccer5<span class="lower">s</span> Australia - Now Open</h2>
    <p>Soccer5s is proud to announce, the opening our first site in Australia. We have 8 five-a-side pitches and 2 seven-a-side pitches. The soccer pitches are in Tuggerah at the Mariners Centre of Excellence. We have formed a unique partnership with the Central Coast Mariners at the development. Soccer5s and the Central Coast Mariners will strive to encourage football development and community involvement throughout the Central Coast. 5-a-sides is great for the entire community and we will provide competitions for men, women and enthusiastic young people and teenagers. Ladies can show off their skills in mixed leagues and prove that soccer isn't just for the boys!</p>
    
    <p>Soccer5s are excited to be involved in the Mariners vision for the development, we look forward to the growth of the beautiful game in the Central Coast and throughout Australia.</p>
