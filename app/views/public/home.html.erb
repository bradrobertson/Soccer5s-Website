    <p>Soccer5s is proud to announce, we will be opening our first site in Australia in October 2011. We will have 8 five-a-side pitches and 2 seven-a-side pitches. The soccer pitches will be in Tuggerah at the Mariners Centre of Excellence. We have formed a unique partnership with the Central Coast Mariners at the development. Soccer5s and the Central Coast Mariners will strive to encourage football development and community involvement throughout the Central Coast. 5-a-sides is great for the entire community and we will provide competitions for men, women and enthusiastic young people and teenagers. Ladies can show off their skills in mixed leagues and prove that soccer isn't just for the boys!</p>
