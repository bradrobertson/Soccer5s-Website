    <div class="rules">
      <h2>Rules</h2>

      <p>All players must be registered to play in Soccer5s leagues. Teams can register squads up to
      15 players per season. Players can only be registered to one team in an individual league set
      up.</p>

      <p>Teams will receive 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw and zero for a loss. League placing will be
      decided by points gained, followed by goal difference, followed by goals scored, followed by
      the aggregate result between the two teams in question.</p>

      <p>For League matches a maximum of eight players per game may be used. All players must be
      named on the team sheet prior to kick off held at Soccer5s reception.</p>

      <p>Teams who play a suspended player will automatically lose the match 10 – 0. A suspended
      player will still have to serve his suspension even though the team has been punished this
      match will not count as a match which the player has missed.</p>

      <p>Teams are asked to arrive 15 minutes prior to appointed kick off times.</p>

      <p>Teams must be on the pitch and ready to begin the match at the appointed kick-off time. If a
      team is 5 minutes late at management’s discretion they may start the match 0-3 down.</p>

      <p>Teams may be replaced at any stage of the season. Replacement teams inherit the scores
      and points of their predecessors. No team joining after the halfway point can be awarded first
      or second place at the end of the season.</p>

      <p>Teams failing to appear for their designated match, will have the match awarded to their
      opponents 10 – 0, for repeated absence the team may be removed from the League. The
      offending team will be due to pay for both their match fees and their opponents match fees
      if they do not show up. If they give 24hours advanced notice they will pay a game and a half
      fee. This payment will be taken automatically from the designated debit/ credit card on file on
      the day.</p>

      <p>In the event that a team refuses to play another team the match will be awarded to the other
      team 10 – 0. The team who refuse to play will pay a full cancellation/ no show fee.</p>

      <p>In the event that a team refuses to complete a match that has already started, the match
      will be awarded to the other team 10 – 0. If the score at the time produces a goal difference
      greater than 10-0 then that score will stand.</p>

      <p>Soccer5s pitches are all weather pitches. Games will be played at all times and weather
      conditions unless adverse weather conditions make the pitches unplayable. Any decision to
      cancel a game can only be made by Soccer5s management. Postponements are not allowed,
      except in exceptional circumstances and at the discretion of Soccer5s management.</p>

      <p>Match Schedules will be listed list at the start of each season and will be posted on the
      Company’s website www.soccer5s.com. Each team captain will have details to access the
      teams schedule and all players can use the website to see future schdules. All league results
      will be displayed at the centre on the website, but Soccer5s will not accept any responsibility
      for any omissions from or inaccuracies in any such fixture lists and/or results. Soccer5s will
      attempt to resolve any issues arising.</p>

      with the other team kicking off from the centre. After a goal has been scored the game will be
      re-started by the team who conceded the goal kicking off from the centre.</p>

      <p>Only the defending goalkeeper is allowed to play the ball inside the goal area and only he
      may handle the ball in this area.</p>

      <p>A goalkeeper gaining or seeking to gain an advantage by leaving his area or by playing the
      ball when it is outside the area will have a penalty awarded against his team. A goalkeeper
      who leaves his box immediately before, during or as part of a save will have a penalty
      awarded against them.</p>

      <p>An outfield player gaining or seeking to gain an advantage by entering his own goal area will
      have a penalty kick awarded against his team.</p>

      <p>An outfield player entering his opponent’s penalty area will be penalized. The game will be re-
      started from the goalkeeper.</p>

      <p>If the ball goes out of play off the goalkeeper, the game will be restarted by the same
      goalkeeper as ‘goalie’s ball’.</p>

      <p>No slide tackles are allowed. Infringement of this rule will lead to a free kick being awarded
      against the offending players’ team, the player who committed the foul will receive an
      automatic yellow card and may be sin binned at the referee’s discretion.</p>

      <p>If the last defending player commits a foul the team will be penalized with a penalty and the
      player who committed the foul will receive a yellow card and a 2 min sin bin.</p>

      <p>When the ball goes into the corner then the closest player attacking or defending has the right
      to the ball. The opposing player must remain 2 metres from the corner and allow the player to
      turn and play the ball. Any opposing player who goes to close, makes a tackle or has ‘a poke’
      will be penalized with a free kick in the corner to the other team.</p>

      <p>All free kicks will be <strong>indirect</strong>.

      <p>Opposition players must be at least two meters from where any freekick is taken. If opposing
      players do not retreat the required two meters they may receive a yellow card. Free Kicks

      metre mark to allow opposition defenders an opportunity to defend.</p>

      <p>The Goalkeeper must be on the goal line when a penalty is being taken. Players may only
      take one step whilst taking a penalty.</p>

      <p>These League Rules are not exhaustive and may be added to or amended at any time.</p>

      <p>The Referees decision on all on-field matters is final and no discussions will be entered into
      either on or off the field with him about any decision. The Referees jurisdiction on disciplinary
      matters will apply until players have entered the changing rooms. Players repeatedly
      disputing decisions may have further disciplinary action taken against them.</p>

      <p>Teams with a valid complaint against a match official must be put in writing within 48 hours of
      the said match. The complaint should be addressed to Soccer5s Centre Management, who
      will make a decision. This decision is final.</p>

      <p>A player sent off for a second offence may be suspended for a minimum of 1 WEEK. In the
      case serious foul play, foul or abusive language the suspension will be extended to 2 WEEKS
      or longer should Soccer5s deem this necessary.</p>

      <p>If a player is given a red card whilst off the field of play (for unacceptable conduct on the
      sideline), the team must correspondingly reduce the number of players on the field.</p>

      <p>If a team is 3 players or less for any reason the match will end. The result will be awarded
      10-0 to their opponents. If the score at the time produces a goal difference greater than 10-0
      then that score will stand.</p>

      <p>If a match is abandoned for any reason the team at fault will receive a 10-0 defeat unless
      the opposing team already has a greater advantage in which case the score will stand. If
      both teams are judged to be at fault the game will be void and both teams will be deducted 5
      points.</p>

      <p>Violent conduct on or off the pitch will result in the immediate suspension of the individual
      and could result in a ban from all Soccer5s premises. Soccer5s reserve the right to ban an
      individual or team from further participation in any or all activities within Soccer5s. Any teams
      found not cooperating with Soccer5s or attempting to deceive could be removed from the
      league program.</p>

      <p>Referees must be treated with respect from all teams. Teams found guilty of abusing
      Referees will be removed from the Leagues, as will Teams in material or persistent breach of
      these Rules.</p>

      <p>The decision of Soccer5s management in all matters pertaining to the administration of the
      league is final.</p>

      <p>Soccer5s reserves the right to alter the rules and punish accordingly if teams or individual
      players are attempting to gain unfair advantage by using an interpretation of rules set by
      Soccer5s</p>
